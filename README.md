This is a container for Advent of Code work with a CLI



`advent.rb <day> <year> <input_file_name>`

day and year will default to the current day and year. input_file_name will default to "input"

The code will place the input in a folder `/<year>/<day>/<input_file_name>` as well as a generic `solution.rb` file to solve the problem in.
